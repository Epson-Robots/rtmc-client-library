# Epson Robot Client Library for Real-time Motion Control

[日本語](./readme_ja.md) / [English](./readme.md)

## 1. Introduction to the Client Library for Real-time Motion Control

This client library is for using the real-time motion control function in an Epson robot controller. You can use the following functions and create an application that uses path planning or trajectory planning calculated in an external device.

- Turn on the motor from an external device
- Control the robot using motion control values based on a path or trajectory planned in an external device

![](./docs/overview.png)

<sup>\*</sup> Epson does not provide the items listed below. You must prepare these items.

- External device: The external device to control the robot.
- Application: The application to control the robot.
- Ethernet cable: The Ethernet cable to connect the external device to the RC800-A.

When using this feature with ROS2, refer to the following README as well.

https://github.com/Epson-Robots/epson-robot-ros2.git

### 1.1 Precautions

- Epson does not provide a function to plan paths or trajectories. You must prepare and develop this yourself.
- Real-time motion control is an advanced function that operates the robot according to motion control values based on a path or trajectory calculated outside the Epson robot controller. Make sure you fully understand path planning/trajectory planning before using.

## 2. Required Equipment

- Epson industrial robot

    For the robots that can be used, see [Supported Models](#21-supported-models).

    // Check if the robot model the Linux PC application is attempting to control is the same as the robot model set in the robot controller.
    user_client.RBCheck("GX4C-251S");

    // Set the end effector weight (kg). In this example, the end effector weight is 3.2 kg.
    user_client.Set_Weight(3.2);

    // Set the load inertia including the end effector and workpiece (kgm^2) and the eccentricity (50 mm). In this example, the load inertia is 0.02 kgm^2 and the eccentricity is 50 mm.
    user_client.Set_Inertia(0.02,50);

    // Turn on motors.
    user_client.MotorOn();

     // Set the power mode to high.
    user_client.PowerHigh();

    // Get the robot's current joint angles.
    user_client.Get_CurrentJA(curja);
    cmdja=curja;

     // Enable the control mode for real-time motion control.
    user_client.SetRTMCModeEnable();

    // End of preprocessing to start robot motion

               user_client.MotorOn();

               // Set the power mode to high.
               user_client.PowerHigh();

               // Get the robot's current joint angles.
               user_client.Get_CurrentJA(curja);
               cmdja=curja;

               // Enable the control mode for real-time motion control.
               ret = user_client.SetRTMCModeEnable();

               continue;

           }else{
            break;
           }

         // End of restart processing after robot controller error, emergency stop, or safeguard door opening
      }
    }

   // Start of processing to end robot motion

    // Disable the control mode for real-time motion control.
    user_client.SetRTMCModeDisable();

    // Turn off motors.
    user_client.MotorOff();

     // Disconnect communications with robot controller.
    user_client.RTMC_DisConnect();

    // End of processing to end robot motion

```

In robot control using real-time motion control, the robot operates according to the motion control values based on the path or trajectory planned externally (by a Linux PC application).

The maximum angular accelerations required for trajectory planning are found in joint_limits.yaml inside the config folder for each robot model in the following folder:

https://github.com/Epson-Robots/epson-robot-ros2/epson_robot_moveit_config/models

The maximum angular velocities are also found in epson_robot_property.xacro inside the urdf folder for each robot model in the following folder:

https://github.com/Epson-Robots/epson-robot-ros2/epson_robot_description/models

These files list the rated values. When moving the robot, adjust the maximum angular acceleration and the maximum angular velocity by taking into consideration the weight and load inertia of the end effector mounted to the robot.

**!!!CAUTION!!!**

Do not create a trajectory that exceeds the maximum joint accelerations in joint_limits.yaml or the maximum angular velocities in epson_robot_property.xacro.

#### 5.6.1 Adjusting the Maximum Angular Acceleration and the Maximum Angular Velocity

When moving the robot, you must adjust the maximum angular acceleration and the maximum angular velocity by taking into consideration the weight, load inertia, and eccentricity of the end effector mounted to the robot. You can calculate these values by multiplying the rated value by the adjustment ratios based on the end effector weight, load inertia, and eccentricity as shown in the following equation.

**Maximum Angular Acceleration Equation**

Max_acc'= Mac_acc * (Coef_weight * 0.001) * (Coef_eccentricity * 0.001)  * (Coef_inertia * 0.001) <sup>\*</sup>

- Max_acc' = Adjusted maximum angular acceleration
- Max_acc = Maximum angular acceleration
- Coef_weight = Adjustment ratio based on the end effector weight
- Coef_eccentricity = Adjustment ratio based on the eccentricity
- Coef_inertia = Adjustment ratio based on the load inertia

<sup>\*</sup> For the three expressions on the right side of the equation, you must consider the 4 axes of a SCARA robot and the 6 axes of a 6-axis robot when calculating the maximum angular velocity.

**Maximum Velocity Equation**

Max_vel'= Mac_vel * (Coef_weight * 0.001)

- Max_vel' = Adjusted maximum angular velocity
- Max_vel = Maximum angular velocity
- Coef_weight = Adjustment ratio based on the end effector weight

For the adjustment ratios of angular velocity and angular acceleration based on end effector weight, refer to the manual for your robot model.  
- "Robot Manual - Automatic Speed Correction at Weight Setting"
- "Robot Manual - Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Weight Setting" (Refer to the values on the vertical axis of the graph.)

For the adjustment ratios of angular velocity based on load inertia, refer to the manual for your robot model.  
"Robot Manual - Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Inertia Setting" (Refer to the values on the vertical axis of the graph.)

For the adjustment ratios of angular acceleration based on eccentricity, refer to the manual for your robot model.  
"Robot Manual - Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Eccentricity Setting" (Refer to the values on the vertical axis of the graph.)

Check the adjustment ratios based on the values of the weight, load inertia, and eccentricity of the end effector mounted to the robot from the graphs. <sup>\*</sup>

When moving the robot, plan the trajectory so that the motion does not exceed the adjusted maximum angular acceleration and maximum acceleration.

<sup>\*</sup>

- The adjustment ratios vary depending on the robot model. Confirm the robot series, weight capacity, and arm length, and then confirm the adjustment ratios.
- Check the standard mode graphs.

Example: This example calculates the adjusted maximum angular acceleration assuming a SCARA robot to which an end effector is mounted with a weight of 4 kg, a load inertia of 0.03 kgm^2, and an eccentricity of 50 mm.

Since the end effector weight is 4 kg, the adjustment ratio for angular acceleration based on the end effector weight is 83 on "Example of Graph in Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Weight Setting."

|Example of Graph in Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Weight Setting|
|:--:|
|![](./docs/weight_example.png)|

Since the load inertia is 0.03 kgm^2, the adjustment ratio for angular acceleration based on the load inertia is 48 on "Example of Graph in Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Inertia Setting."

|Example of Graph in Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Inertia Setting|
|:--:|
|![](./docs/inertia_example.png)|

Since the eccentricity is 50 mm, the adjustment ratio for angular acceleration based on the eccentricity is 70 on "Example of Graph in Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Eccentricity Setting."

|Example of Graph in Automatic Acceleration/Deceleration Correction at Eccentricity Setting|

|![](./docs/eccentricity_example.png)|

If the rated maximum angular acceleration of the robot is 35.00 [rad/s^2], then the adjusted maximum angular acceleration is the value calculated with the following equation:

35.00 * 0.83 * 0.7 = 20.34

For J4, the adjusted maximum angular acceleration is the value calculated with the following equation:

35.00 * 0.83 * 0.7 * 0.48 = 9.76

### 5.7 Free Running Distance and Free Running Time

For details on the free running distance and the free running time, refer to the following manuals: <sup>\*</sup>  
- "Robot Manual - Stopping Time and Stopping Distance at Emergency Stop"
- "Robot Manual - Stopping Time and Stopping Distance When Safeguard Is Open"

<sup>\*</sup>

- The free running distance and the free running time vary depending on the robot model. Confirm the robot series, weight capacity, and arm length, and then confirm the free running distance and free running time.
- Check the standard mode graphs.

## 6. Information on the Security Files

Use OpenSSL<sup>\*</sup> to create the files to set for ca_cert_filepath, client_cert_filepath, and client_private_key with [Set_SecProperty](#set_secproperty). For the files to set for client_governance_filepath and client_permissions_filepath, run create_secfile.py in the script folder of the client library to create the unsigned files. Use OpenSSL<sup>\*</sup> to sign these files.

When you run this script file, the following folders are created, and the secure files for both the Linux PC application and the controller are created. When you use the secure files created by this script with [Set_SecProperty](#set_secproperty), use the secure files for the Linux PC application.

```
[Folder in which the script is run]

## 7. Using the Demo Programs

This package has three types of demo programs. Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and other environment variables so that the demo program can load the client library.

- Standard demo: A demo program that moves only the J1 axis with real-time motion control.
- I/O demo: A demo program that controls the J1 axis and standard I/O outputs with real-time motion control.
- Secure demo: A demo program that moves only the J1 axis with real-time motion control over secure communications.

Run the demo programs as described below.

- Specify the robot model to control as the first command line argument.
- Specify the password set for the controller as the second command line argument. (You can omit the password if the controller is not password protected.)

The following example runs the standard demo for when the controller password is set to "user" and the robot model is the GX4-C251S.

```shell-session
./epson_rtmc_demo GX4-C251S user
```

When you run the secure demo, import the secure files contained in the demo/rc_cert folder into the controller first, and enable the secure communications settings in the controller. For detailed information on the secure communications settings in the controller, refer to the following manual:  
"Epson RC+ 8.0 User's Guide - Real-time Motion Control"
